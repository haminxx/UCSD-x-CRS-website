                Staff accounts require a UC San Diego email and a valid invite

                The Site describes Team roles—including Driver, Engineer, PIT

                link to external application forms for specific recruitment
                cycles (for example, Fall 2026). Role descriptions are provided
                for informational purposes and may change based on competition

                Submitting an application does not guarantee selection,

                availability, conduct, safety requirements, and organizational
                needs. Additional eligibility, licensing, fitness, or safety
                requirements may apply to competition roles, particularly for
                drivers and pit crew, as mandated by CRS rules and event
                organizers.

                These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California,

                dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site
                will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts
                located in San Diego County, California, and you consent to the
                personal jurisdiction of those courts.

                We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes
                in our practices, Site features, legal requirements, or Team
                operations. When we make material changes, we will update the
                &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this page. Your
                continued use of the Site after changes become effective
                constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree
                to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Site.

                We may suspend or terminate your access to the Site or Staff
                Portal at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we
                believe violates these Terms, poses a security risk, or is
                otherwise harmful to the Team. Provisions that by their nature
                should survive termination—including intellectual property,
                disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and
                governing law—will survive.
