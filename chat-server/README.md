# Recruitment chat server (Render + OpenAI)

Small Express proxy: browser → this server → OpenAI Chat API.
The OpenAI API key stays in Render Environment — never in the static site or GitHub.

Knowledge for the chatbot is loaded from a **Google Drive folder** (when configured) and falls back to `knowledge.md` if Drive sync fails.

## Quick setup (you do this once)

### 1. Get an OpenAI API key

OpenAI does **not** have a permanent free API tier like Gemini. You need an account with billing enabled, but **`gpt-4o-mini`** is very cheap for a small recruitment chatbot (often pennies per month).

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up / log in
3. Open [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) → **Create new secret key**
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-…`) — you won't see it again
5. Open [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing) and add a payment method + a small credit limit (e.g. $5/month) if prompted

New accounts sometimes receive starter credits — check your [Usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage) page.

### 2. Google Drive knowledge sync

The chatbot reads from this folder:

- Folder: [CRS recruitment knowledge](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x1aL_4j-xgzGf7idPT1DWSgjzr1GN8CF?usp=sharing)
- Folder ID: `1x1aL_4j-xgzGf7idPT1DWSgjzr1GN8CF`

Supported file types:

| Type | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Google Docs | Exported as plain text |
| PDF | Text extracted with `pdf-parse` |
| Other | Skipped with a warning in server logs |

The server caches Drive content in memory (default **10 minutes**) and refreshes on startup and when the cache is stale.

#### Option A — Service account (recommended)

Most reliable for listing folder contents on Render.

1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → create or select a project
2. **APIs & Services** → **Library** → enable **Google Drive API**
3. **APIs & Services** → **Credentials** → **Create credentials** → **Service account**
4. Create the account → **Keys** → **Add key** → **JSON** → download the JSON file
5. Open the JSON and copy the `client_email` value (e.g. `ucsd-crs-chat@….iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
6. In Google Drive, open the [knowledge folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x1aL_4j-xgzGf7idPT1DWSgjzr1GN8CF?usp=sharing) → **Share** → add the service account email as **Viewer**
7. On Render, set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` to either:
   - The full JSON string (paste as one line), or
   - Base64-encoded JSON (easier for multiline paste issues)

#### Option B — API key (public folder)

May work if the folder and all files are shared as **Anyone with the link → Viewer**. Listing folders with only an API key is less reliable than a service account.

1. Google Cloud Console → enable **Google Drive API**
2. **Credentials** → **Create credentials** → **API key**
3. Restrict the key to **Google Drive API** (recommended)
4. On Render, set `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

If listing fails with a 403/404, switch to Option A and share the folder with the service account.

#### Render environment variables (Drive)

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | No (has default) | `1x1aL_4j-xgzGf7idPT1DWSgjzr1GN8CF` |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | One of these | Service account JSON (raw or base64) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | One of these | Google API key for public folder access |
| `DRIVE_KNOWLEDGE_TTL_MS` | No | Cache TTL in ms (default `600000` = 10 min) |
| `DRIVE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_CHARS` | No | Max knowledge chars (default `80000`) |

Until Drive credentials are set, the server uses `knowledge.md` automatically.

### 3. Update Render

1. [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com) → **ucsd-x-crs-website**
2. **Environment**:
   - **Delete** `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL` (no longer used)
   - **Add** `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your `sk-…` key (no quotes)
   - **Add** `OPENAI_MODEL` = `gpt-4o-mini` (optional — this is the default)
   - **Add** `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` = `1x1aL_4j-xgzGf7idPT1DWSgjzr1GN8CF` (optional — default in code)
   - **Add** `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` and/or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (see above)
3. **Settings** (confirm):
   - Root Directory = `chat-server`
   - Build Command = `npm install`
   - Start Command = `npm start`
4. **Manual Deploy** → **Clear build cache & deploy** (after first Drive setup)
5. Wait until **Live**, then open `/health` — expect:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "provider": "openai",
  "hasKey": true,
  "keyFormatValid": true,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "knowledgeSource": "drive",
  "driveKnowledgeLoaded": true,
  "driveFileCount": 3,
  "lastDriveSync": "2026-07-11T…",
  "knowledgeChars": 12345
}
```

If Drive is not configured yet:

```json
{
  "knowledgeSource": "file",
  "driveKnowledgeLoaded": false,
  "driveConfigured": false
}
```

### 4. Test chat

1. https://ucsdxcrs.web.app/recruitment/
2. Send a message (first request after idle may take 30–60s on Render free tier)

## Local test

```bash
cd chat-server
npm install
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
set GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account",...}
npm start
```

Then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_API_URL=http://localhost:10000/api/recruitment-chat` for local Next.

Check sync status: `http://localhost:10000/health`

## Update FAQ answers

**With Drive sync (preferred):** edit or add files in the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x1aL_4j-xgzGf7idPT1DWSgjzr1GN8CF?usp=sharing). Changes appear within the cache TTL (~10 minutes) without redeploying.

**Fallback (no Drive credentials):**

1. Edit `content/recruitment-faq.md`
2. Copy to `chat-server/knowledge.md`
3. Push to GitHub — Render auto-redeploys

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `/health` → `hasKey: false` | Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` on Render |
| `knowledgeSource: "file"` with `driveConfigured: true` | Check `driveSyncError` in `/health`; verify folder is shared with service account |
| `driveSyncError` mentions 403 / access | Share folder with service account email (Viewer) |
| `invalid_key` | Wrong/revoked key — create a new one at platform.openai.com/api-keys |
| `billing` / `insufficient_quota` | Add payment method + credits in OpenAI billing settings |
| `knowledgeTruncated: true` | Large PDF — trim source doc or raise `DRIVE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_CHARS` |
| Slow first reply | Render free tier cold start — retry once |

## Security

| Store here | OpenAI key? | Google credentials? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | No | No |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` | No | No |
| Render Environment | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Public chat API URL | OK (endpoint only) | No |
